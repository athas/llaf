# GPT-2 Inference

This example demonstrates how to invoke llaf from Python to produce text using GPT-2. It supports pre-trained Hugging Face models, whose parameters are appropriately reshaped for llaf on the first use and saved as `.npz` files. Please follow these instructions to run the model:

1. Make sure the appropriate OpenCL runtime is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to this directory.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Convert `llm.fut` into a Python module: `futhark pyopencl --library ../../src/llm.fut -o llm`.
5. Run the inference script with your desired prompt: `python main.py "Prompt goes here"`.
    * Arguments:
    * `--name`: GPT-2 variant to use.
        * Options are `gpt2`, `gpt2-medium`, `gpt2-large`, and `gpt2-xl`.
    * `--cnt`: Number of additional tokens to generate.
    * `--benchmark`: Flag for benchmarking llaf against Hugging Face.
    * `--dump DIR`: dumps parameters and encoded prompt to the given directory as individual files in the Futhark binary data format.

With the initial prompt of `Once upon a time`, laff can be anywhere from 3x to 10x slower than the Hugging Face implementation of GPT-2 on an RTX 2070 GPU, as seen below. Despite its poor relative performance, the Futhark compiler still does a decent job, especially considering that it's aimed towards general array computations and isn't optimized for deep learning.
